**How it works?**

This project inspired by [this repos](https://github.com/Hephyrius/binance_futures_bot).

This bot use a startigy called [Talon Sniper](https://www.tradingview.com/script/Kt8v4HcD-Talon-Sniper-v1/).

This staregy shows a good performance in non trending market and a good performance in trending market, therfore, the bot verfiy the trend of the market befor opening any position by using [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) indicator.

I still modify the README.md when i have time.
